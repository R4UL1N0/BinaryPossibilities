# Binary Possibilities

Given a length, do:
- Math.pow(2, LENGTH); result is going to be the size of array
- LENGTH will be size of string
- "0" and "1" will be the only possible characters for the stream
- Set<String> will store the unique binary values generated in the for loop
- You will have an array with all the possible unique values
